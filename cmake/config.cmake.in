# Find dependencies required by the axolote library
# Use the same find_package calls as in the main CMakeLists.txt,
# but ensure they are REQUIRED for the installed package to work.
# Use QUIET to avoid noisy output when users find_package(axolote)

find_dependency(glfw3 CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_dependency(glm REQUIRED) # Assuming glm provides find_dependency support or a Findglm.cmake
find_dependency(assimp CONFIG REQUIRED) # Assuming users need assimp installed separately

# Include the generated targets file
# This defines the imported target axolote::axolote

# Check that all required components (targets) are available
# This is mainly useful if you have optional components in your library
